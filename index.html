        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a full-time student at Brigham Young University. Currently, I am living in 
          Houston, Texas and doing online schooling while I take care of my great
          grandfather. In my free time, I love playing all types of sports, playing my
          guitar, and hanging out with friends and family. I have three younger siblings,
          two loving parents, and a dog named Dude. 
        </p>
        <p>
          An interesting fact about me is that I lived in Mexico for three years and speak fluent Spanish. 
          I am also planning to serve my mission in Portugal in a few months!
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's a little about me!

          Caregiver Tool, my startup application, will allow at-home caregivers like me to record their patients'
          vitals, track their health over time using graphs, and message other caregivers/healthcare providers.
